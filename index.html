        <div>
            <h4>A Strict Father</h4><p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Joe Jackson</a>  was a very strict father. He didn't allow the kids to have a lot of friends and he often whipped the children if they disobeyed. He wanted them to stay out of trouble and away from gangs. Later, when the Jackson 5 was still getting started, Joe would push the boys to practice for hours. He would hit them or verbally abuse them if they made a mistake.</p>

        <div><h4>Fame</h4><p>The Jackson five 5 continued to have success. They released more number one singles like "ABC", "I'll Be There", and "The Love You Save." As the lead singer, Michael was becoming very famous. He couldn't go to school because he would be mobbed by fans, so he was taught by private tutors in between rehearsals and concerts. Michael was just a kid when all this happened. He didn't get to play with other kids his age and later felt like he missed out on having a childhood.</p></div>
        <!--Mchael Jackson Solo Career-->
        <div><h4>
            Michael Begins a Solo Career</h4>
        <p>
            While still singing with the Jackson 5, Michael had a number of solo albums. At first his solo career didn't take off, but he did have a few hit songs including "Ben" and "Got to Be There." However, in 1978 Michael met music producer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Quincy Jones</a>  while working on the set of the movie The Wiz. He broke away from the family band and worked on his first "grown up" album. In 1979, Michael released the album Off the Wall. It was a huge hit and had four top ten songs including the number one singles <i>"Rock with You" and "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough."</i>  Michael was now one of the biggest stars in music.</p></div>
            <div><h4><a href="https://youtu.be/rLMr9CsJHME">Thriller</a> </h4><p>Michael wanted to follow up Off the Wall with an even bigger album. This was going to be quite the task. He worked with Quincy Jones again and in late 1982 released the album Thriller. The album was a huge success. It had seven top ten singles and won eight Grammy awards. Eventually, Thriller would become the best selling album of all time. Michael had now become the biggest star in the music industry.
                
                In addition to the music on Thriller, Michael also broke new ground with his music videos. Up until that time, most music videos just showed the band or singer performing the song. Michael wanted to create a story with his videos. These new types of music videos became very popular and changed the way music videos were made. The most famous of his videos was a 13 minute long video for the album's title song Thriller. It was later voted as the most influential music video of all time.
